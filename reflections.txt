Reflections Questions:
How long did you spend working on this project?
I spend about two full days working on this project.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding challenge was getting all the requirements of the project to work.
Several of them took me quite some time to try to decipher and figure out.

What two additional features did you build?  Why?
New Feature #1:

I added brand information to the product class.  I wanted to be able to calculate the inventory
for each brand of a product.  I created a method to calculate the total
number of products for each brand.  

New Feature #2:

I added an ID class method to the customer class so that each customer will have an ID.
I then included a find by ID method so the customer can be looked up by ID.  

The code that I used to test my features is at the bottom of this file.

Where do you still have room to grow?
I still have lots of room to grow in all facets of programming.  I am only beginning to feel
like things are starting to click.  I can understand in my head what I want the program to do,
but I haven't yet mastered the syntax of how to make it happen.



Test code:

require_relative "lib/errors"
require_relative "lib/customer"
require_relative "lib/product"
require_relative "lib/transaction"


#NEW FEATURES

# Adds products with brand info
Product.new(title: "LEGO Iron Man vs. Ultron", price: 22.99, stock: 55, brand: "LEGO")
Product.new(title: "Nano Block Empire State Building", price: 49.99, stock: 12, brand: "Nano Blocks")
Product.new(title: "LEGO Firehouse Headquarter", price: 199.99, stock: 2, brand: "LEGO")

# Prints number of products by brand
puts Product.number_of_products("LEGO")
puts Product.number_of_products("Nano Blocks")

# Adds new customer and prints by id
Customer.new(name: "Walter Latimer")
walter = Customer.find_by_name("Walter Latimer")
puts walter.id
